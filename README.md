# TODO List
- Add multiple languages?!?!
    - Say to use the top 10-15 most used languages I guess.
    - Decide if to serve different static pages, or have a javascript widget that makes the browser translate it?
        - Pros: Widget is a lot easier plus reduces strain on a pretty weak server
        - Con: Translation might not be perfect.

- Are we gonna have newsletters?
- Site is pretty SEO optimised, but sometimes the map in the middle doesn't load. Need to address the issue
